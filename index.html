		<h2> Data Acquisition </h2>
		<p> We acquired all the datasets that cover 124 years of Olympics. 
			There is one dataset for Tokyo 2020, one for Rio 2016, and one for all the Summer Olympics between 1896 and 2014. As we realized that it wasn't possible to parse the number of medal counts for each country using our current datasets, we also found another dataset (in addition to our earlier three))that has all the medal counts for each summer Olympic year.</p>
		<p>We had to parse four datasets differently. We completed parsing 2016 and 2020 in a structure we need it to be. We also have parsed the dataset which covers the other years. </p>
		<p> You can find cleaned-up csv files in data folder.</p>

			<p> So far, we do not have any changes in our final design. We have not implemented the bubble charts fully yet, but we expect to have that done by next milestone </p>

		<h2> <strong> Working Visualization Prototype </strong> </h2>
		<p> ** Our website only runs all the charts for Rio 2016 and Tokyo 2020 for now. For other years, you can only see the medal charts for now.**</p>
		<p> We will link to other years, but for now, we linked to the year with the most confined dataset </p>
