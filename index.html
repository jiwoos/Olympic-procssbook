			<h3> <strong> Brain Storming Sheet </strong> </h3>
			<p> We first wrote down some stuffs that could be visualized in our project.
				Then we narrowed it down/filtered it out with pink highlights to find what we really want to focus on.
				The blue letters were written during filtering out process. </p>

			<h3> <strong> Fourth Design </strong> </h3>
			<p> As we looked into the data, we figured out some of the countries back in 1896, 1968 and many other past years could not be represented in current world map.
				We decided to use bubble chart instead of the world map. The bubble charts group countries by continents. The size of each bubble is the number of athletes in each country.
			The colors of groups are the color of Olympic Rings </p>
