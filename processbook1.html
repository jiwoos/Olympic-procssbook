	<div class = "background">
		<p> <strong> Background and Motivation </strong> </p>
		<p> The one competition that has accompanied the world over the last century is the Olympics. Each Olympic event often is a representation of that time, year, or even era. We believe visualizing such data that were collected over 124 years can show so many things, including but not limited to - changes in gender equality, increase in participating countries, and transition in dynamics between countries. Moreover, we became avid watchers of the Olympics during the pandemic when we were confined to the spaces of our homes unable to attend any in person events. So we thought that it would be entertaining to observe the world through the lens of sports and entertainment, rather than through political news.
		</p>

	</div>

	<div class = "objectives">
		<p> <strong> Project Objectives </strong> </p>

			<li>A primary question: Looking at Olympic data, how has gender representation changed over the years?  </li>
			<li> Another Question: Looking at the Olympics over the last 120 years, what are the changes in power dynamics in countries? (Implicitly) </li>
			<li> We would like to learn when gender representation started to become more “equal.” </li>
			<li> Fans of the Olympics get a better picture of how the Olympics have changed over the years. </li>

	<div class = "data">
		<p> <strong> Data </strong> </p>
		<p> We are collecting our data from Kaggle. We want data from the years 1896 to 2020 about the Olympics in terms of gender distribution and medal count.  </p>
		 <p> Link of Datasets: </p>
		<li> https://www.kaggle.com/the-guardian/olympic-games?select=summer.csv </li>
		This is our main dataset where we have the data about the sports and medals from the years 1896 to 2014.
		<li> Our dataset for 2016: https://www.kaggle.com/rio2016/olympic-games </li>

 		<li> Our dataset for the 2021 Tokyo: https://www.kaggle.com/arjunprasadsarkhel/2021-olympics-in-tokyo
		<p> </p>
	</div>


	<div class = "data-processing">
		<p> <strong> Data Processing </strong> </p>
		<p>Yes, we will need to do some substantial data cleanup in order to make it a better format for us to use when doing the different visualizations. The first thing we will do is parse the main dataset into separate csv files for each Olympic year. We plan on deriving the number of females and males for each Olympic year and also the medal counts for each country for each Olympic year. We will parse the data using Python libraries.

		<p> <strong> Visualization Design </strong> <p>


				<div id ="0">
					<h3> <strong> Brain Storming Sheet </strong> </h3>
					<p> We first wrote down some stuffs that could be visualized in our project.
						Then we narrowed it down/filtered it out with pink highlights to find what we really want to focus on.
						The blue letters were written during filtering out process. </p>
					<img src="images/brainStorming.jpg" width="400px" border="1px solid gray">
				</div>
				<div id ="1">
					<h3> <strong> First Design </strong> </h3>
					<p> We first focused on Tokyo 2020 specifically.</p>
					<img src="images/initialDesign.jpg" width="400px" border="1px solid gray">
					<p> Positive/Negative: Good initial ideas, but not interactive enough and just shows bulk of data at once.  </p>
				</div>
				<div id ="2">
					<h3> <strong> Second Design </strong> </h3>
					<p> As written in the image, we decided to be more general. Our target data is now summer Olympics for last 120 years. </p>
					<img src="images/initialDesign2.jpg" width="400px"  border="1px solid gray">
					<p>  Positive: A more interactive visualization as we can look through 29 different Olympics.  </p>
					<p> Negative: Too unorganized, not too intuitive how to navigate the page. </p>
				</div>
				<div id="3">
					<h3> <strong> Third Design </strong> </h3>
					<p> We developed the idea with more charts so that we could visualize some important data. </p>
					<img src="images/progressDesign1.jpg" width= "400px" border="1px solid gray">
					<p> Positive: Using a map makes it more intuitive to visualize a world event like the Olympics.  </p>
					<p> Negative: It may be difficult to use the geo mapping on d3 as countries have changed in the 120 years such as USSR, West Germany, etc. </p>

				</div>
				<div id="4">
					<h3> <strong> Fourth Design </strong> </h3>
					<p> As we looked into the data, we figured out some of the countries back in 1896, 1968 and many other past years could not be represented in current world map.
						We decided to use bubble chart instead of the world map. The bubble charts group countries by continents. The size of each bubble is the number of athletes in each country.
					The colors of groups are the color of Olympic Rings </p>
					<img src="images/progressDesign2.jpg" width= "400px" border="1px solid gray">
					<p>
						Positive/negative: Bubble layout may not be the easiest/ most intuitive visualization to make, but I think we may need to code it first before we tweak how it will look like.  </p>
				</div>

				<div id="5">
					<h3> <strong> Wire Frame of the Final Design </strong> </h3>
					<p> This is the polished version of the final design. Click the link to see in pdf format
					<a href="images/Olympics.pdf">Wire frame of final design</a> </p>
					<li> Layout: </li>
					<img src="images/screenshot1.jpg" width= "400px" >
					<img src="images/screenshot2.jpg" width= "400px" >
				</div>

				<li> Focus: </li>
					<ul> Timeline </ul>
					<ul>Bubble Map</ul>
					<ul>Percentage bar charts for gender distribution.</ul>
					<ul>Horizontal bar chart for medal counts</ul>
				<li> Operation: </li>
					<ul>User clicks on the timeline which will open up the map below for the year clicked. It will also display the gender distribution and top 10 countries in terms of medal count visualizations.</ul>
					<ul>If the user clicks on a bubble, it will open up the information for that country on the right.</ul>
					<ul>If they hit the drop down box next to the “Compare with other Olympics” text, it will have the choices of the other olympics and the gender distribution and medal count distribution of that olympics will pop up.</ul>



			<p> <strong>  Must-Have Features </strong><p>
				<ul> Timeline that shows the different summer olympic years </ul>
				<ul>Some map that displays the different countries</ul>
				<ul> Comparison of gender distributions </ul>
				<ul> Top 10 country medal counts. </ul>
			<p> <strong>  Optional Features </strong> </p>
				<ul> Hover over the timeline shows city names. </ul>
				<ul> Hover effect for the map </ul>
				<ul> Show fun facts about total numbers over the 120 years such as who got the most medals (athlete/country/gender) who got the most silver medals. </ul>

<div class="schedule">
	<p> <strong> Schedule </strong> <p>
	<ol type="1">
		<li> We will split the datasets, one will take the biggest dataset and one will take the smaller two datasets and parse for the following: </li>
			<ul> <strong> 11/02 </strong> Work on parsing of data (for gender distribution) </ul>
			<ul> <strong>11/04 </strong>Try to finish parsing data (for medal count by country) </ul>
			<ul> <strong>11/05 </strong>Work on parsing data into javascript </ul>
		<li> Working on framework of visualization </li>
			<ul> <strong>By 11/07 </strong> </ul>
			<ul> Work on displaying the timeline  </ul>
			<ul>Work on visualizing the map </ul>
			<ul> For the other visualization aspects, we will create placeholders for them that are not interactive.</ul>
		<ul>  <strong> 11/08 </strong> Milestone 1 due </ul>
		 <ul> By <strong> 11/14 </strong> Work on the click map functionalities like showing total medal count for each country clicked on the map.</ul>
		<ul> By  <strong> 11/19 </strong> Finish the select a olympics to compare gender distributions functionality </ul>
		<ul> By <strong> 11/21 </strong> Polish the top 10 medal count visualization. </ul>
